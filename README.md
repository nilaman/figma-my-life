Peer Review by : Aaron Robinson - The page looks organized and does everything that the assignment requires. I like that the nav bar has an animation when you hover over it that's a nice touch. My only gripe is that the carousel pictures are all different heights, so when clicking throught it, the text boxes underneath shift up and down. This is just a design issue and is not something that the assignment requires. Great job on the code overall, I will try the border-box style in my next project.
